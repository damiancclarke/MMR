\multicolumn{6}{p{13.4cm}}{\begin{footnotesize}\textsc{Notes:} Maternal mortality is expressed in terms of    deaths per 100,000 live births. Immunization is expressed as the percent of   children of ages 12-23 months who are immunized against diphtheria, pertussis  and tetanus (DPT). Fertility represents births per woman, and teen births are expressed as the number of births per 1000 women between the ages of 15--19. Husband and wife fertility preferences are only available for DHS countries.\end{footnotesize}} \\ \bottomrule \end{tabular}\end{center}\end{table}
