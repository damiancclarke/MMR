\multicolumn{5}{p{14.5cm}}{\begin{footnotesize}\textsc{Notes:}
    Reforms for Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Kenya are described in more detail in
    section \ref{scn:empiricalexperiment}.  For Nigeria, the main treatment
    group is 1970-`75, however 1965-`69 may be affected by overage enrolment.
    For Kenya, cohorts born between 1963 and 1972 are expected to be partially
    treated, while post-1972 cohorts are completely treated.
