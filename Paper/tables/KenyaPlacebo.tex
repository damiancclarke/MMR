A placebo treatment here is defined by comparing two groups who had already left primary school by the time of the reform in 1985.  The placebo `treatment' was defined as occurring in 1977, and hence affecting (at least partially) birth cohorts from 1955 to 1963, rather than the true affected cohorts of 1964 to 1972.
