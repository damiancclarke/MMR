\begin{abstract}
We examine whether a causal relationship exists between maternal education and 
maternal mortality. Despite considerable evidence in favour of a causal 
relationship between education and a range of other health behaviours and 
outcomes, and a significant gradient between maternal mortality and education 
across time and countries, no comprehensive study exists to examine whether this 
relationship is---at least in part---causal.  By forming a large panel of data 
consisting of 108 countries over 20 years, and by examining three natural 
experiments resulting in plausibly exogenous expansions in education, we present 
considerable evidence that increases in maternal education causally reduce the 
likelihood of dying in child birth.  The size of this relationship is 
considerable.  Our preferred estimates suggest that a country moving from 0 to 1 
years of education will reduce maternal mortality by 174 deaths per 100,000 
births, while moving from 7 to 8 years results in a smaller, but still 
significant, 15 deaths per 100,000 births.

%INTRODUCTION
%================================================================================
\section{Introduction}
Life expectancy exhibits a consistently positive gradient in education that, 
unlike income gradients, tends not to diminish as education levels rise and is 
evident across and within rich and poor countries \citep{RichardsBarry1998, 
KunstMackenbach1994, EloPreston1996, LlerasMuney2005, Mearaetal2008}. Maternal 
mortality is an important determinant of life expectancy for women in developing 
countries but there is not much evidence of the relationship between maternal 
mortality and education. This paper attempts to fill that gap.

Every day, approximately 800 women die from preventable causes related to 
pregnancy and childbirth, 99\% of all maternal deaths occur in developing 
countries and they are largely preventable \citep{WHO2012}. The maternal 
mortality ratio in developing countries is 240 per 100,000 births versus 16 per 
100,000 in developed countries. There are large disparities between and within 
countries, with a few countries having extremely high maternal mortality ratios 
of 1,000 or more per 100,000 live births; more than half of all maternal deaths 
occur in sub-Saharan Africa and almost one third occur in South Asia 
\citep{WHO2012}. The WHO identifies poverty, limited access to public services, 
cultural practices and lack of information as the main causes or sources of 
variation in maternal mortality ratios.

Between 1990 and 2010, maternal mortality worldwide dropped by almost 50\%. 
While this is impressive, certainly relative to trends in the preceding twenty 
years, the average rate of decline in the global maternal mortality ratio (the 
number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) of 3.1\% per year over this 
period falls well below the annual decline of 5.5\% required to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDG) for maternal health adopted by the 
international community in 2000. There are signs of increasing policy commitment 
to addressing maternal mortality: official development assistance for maternal 
and new-born health has risen relative, for instance, to funding for child 
health \citep{Grecoetal2008}.\footnote{Overall donor disbursements increased from 
US\$2,119 million in 2003 to \$3,482 million in 2006; funding for child
health increased by 63\% and that for maternal and new-born health increased by 
66\%. In the 68 priority countries, child-related disbursements increased from a 
mean of \$4 per child in 2003 to \$7 per child in 2006; disbursements for 
maternal and neonatal health increased from \$7 per live birth in 2003 to \$12 
per live birth in 2006.}

However policy documents on maternal mortality seldom indicate education as a 
cause and the academic literature has very little to say about the relationship 
between maternal mortality and education. This said,
there is a lively literature in economics that documents a positive correlation 
between education and other indicators of health. One possibility, relatively 
uninteresting for policy, is that this correlation is driven by time preference, 
people with lower discount rates tending to invest more in both forms of human 
capital.  While this is likely so, the crop of studies that identify causal 
effects of education on health most often tend to associate this with educated 
people engaging in healthier behaviours, for instance, smoking and drinking
less and being more likely to seek prenatal care, adopt new drugs or adhere to 
treatment for disease \citep{GoldmanSmith2010, GoldmanLakdawalla2001, 
CurrieMoretti2003, LichtenburgLlerasMuney2005, CutlerLlerasMuney2010,
GliedLlerasMuney2010, JensenLlerasMuney2012}. This is consistent with the 
efficacy that education confers in acquiring and processing relevant information 
\citep{Rosenzweig1995, RosenzweigSchultz1989, CutlerLlerasMuney2010}. Education 
may also influence health through its influence on income and, thereby, the 
facility to purchase health inputs, but the impacts of education on health tend to 
be larger than direct impacts of income, to hold conditional upon income, and to 
be similar for men and women, at least in richer countries \citep{LlerasMuney2005, 
CutlerLlerasMuney2010}.

The proximate causes of maternal mortality are pregnancy complications such as 
pre-eclampsia, bleeding, infections and unsafe abortion.\footnote{We provide a
more extensive discussion of the medical literature related to maternal mortality
and death in and surrounding childbirth in appendix \ref{scn:medliterature}.} To 
the extent that educated women are more likely to adopt simple and low-cost 
practices to maintain hygiene, are more able to react to symptoms such as bleeding 
or high blood pressure, more likely to assess the information on abortion and place 
of abortion, and more willing to accept
treatment and birth attendance, education may plausibly cause declines in maternal 
mortality. Moreover, if these are the mechanisms by which it acts then education 
may have an impact on maternal mortality conditional upon the state of health 
services. The payoff to education tends to be higher in circumstances where 
learning is important, for instance, circumstances of structural and technological 
change \citep{FosterRosenzweig2004}. Such change is characteristic of developing 
countries which, in the post-war period, have experienced massive technological 
change in the public health sphere \citep{Cutleretal2006} as well as changes in 
the economic (and occupational) structure.

Using panel data for 108 developing countries and new estimates of maternal 
mortality ratios for 1990-2010, we estimate the relationship between maternal 
mortality and educational attainment under the standard panel data identifying 
assumptions, unconditional and conditional upon indicators of income, public 
health provision and fertility. We find large and consistently significant impacts 
of education. Indeed, depending upon the specification, the (standardized) impacts 
of education on maternal mortality are equal to or larger than the impacts of 
skilled birth attendance, an instrument that the WHO currently focuses upon in 
devising programs to address maternal mortality. In contrast, within-country 
variation in GDP has no significant impact on maternal mortality conditional upon 
education. We supplement the cross-country analysis with quasi-experimental case 
studies from Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Kenya. These are three countries that 
implemented substantial education reforms. We use cohort and region variation in 
education generated by the reform, which we argue is plausibly exogenous. To match 
this to maternal mortality rates, we construct cohort mortality rates for regions 
within these countries using the Demographic and Health Surveys. In two of the 
three case we identify a sizeable and negative impact of improvements in education 
on maternal mortality. In both Nigeria and Zimbabwe we find that the educational 
expansions due to policy experiments significantly reduce maternal death in
affected cohorts, and find that these results are surprisingly close to those 
estimated in cross-country regressions.  In Kenya---which experienced a schooling 
extension at the lower high school level---we do not find evidence of such a 
reduction, estimating that the effect on maternal mortality is not significantly 
different to zero.

All in all, this paper generates new data on maternal mortality that is available 
for individuals within regions and states of countries, and it provides what would 
appear to be the first systematic consideration of the relationship between 
maternal mortality ratios and education. It opens up several avenues for further 
research.

%METHODOLOGY
%================================================================================
\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Cross-Country Analysis}
In order to examine the effect of educational expansions on maternal mortality, 
we run country-level regressions of the following form:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:panel}
   MMR_{it}=\alpha_i+\mathbf{educ}_{it}\beta + \mathbf{W}_{it}\gamma+\delta_t+
   \varepsilon_{it},
\end{equation}
where $MMR_{it}$ refers to the maternal mortality rate in country $i$ and period 
$t$, $\mathbf{educ}_{it}$ to a series of variables measuring the percent of the 
population with a given level of education, and $\mathbf{W}_{it}$ refers to a 
vector of relevant country- and time-varying covariates.  Given that we have both 
temporal and regional variation in the variables of interest, we employ a 
fixed-effects methodology which allows for us to control for all time-fixed 
country-specific factors which may confound the analysis in (\ref{eqn:panel}).
The ability to eliminate these time invariant factors is particularly important 
in this analysis, given that many unobserved factors, such as the institutional 
and political aspects of a given country, are likely to be correlated with both 
maternal mortality and educational attainment. Whilst some of these variables are 
not strictly ``time-invariant'', they evolve sufficiently slowly that our analysis 
over a comparatively short time horizon will mean that a fixed-effect estimator 
will largely control for them. We cluster standard errors at the level of the 
country (allowing for the stochastic term $u_{it}$ to be correlated over time for 
each $i$.)\footnote{In certain cases when we restrict to only certain sub-groups
of countries, the number of countries in each regression is less than 50.  Rule
of thumb-type considerations suggest that clustering standard errors using less
than around 50 clusters is not optimal \citep{AngristPischke2009,NicholsSchaffer2007}.  
In these cases we also estimate using heteroscedasticity robust standar errors, 
and wild bootstrapped standard errors \citep{MackinnonWebb2014,CameronMiller2015}. 
To be conservative, we always report the set of estimates with the largest 
standard errors (on our variables of interest).}

We are able to estimate (\ref{eqn:panel}) for a number of different subgroups. 
Whilst we primarily focus on women of reproductive age, our data allows us to run 
a similar analysis for educational attainment of both gender groups and for 
various age subgroups created within the fertile age range. We also segregate 
countries by region- and income-level, and present group-specific estimates of the 
above specification. A full list of the educational variables which we use and a 
description of the time varying covariates $\textbf{W}_{it}$ is provided in the 
data section of this document.

\subsection{Natural Experiments}
\label{scn:empiricalexperiment}
In addition to (\ref{eqn:panel}) which we estimate with panel data, we focus on a 
number of country-specific cases in countries which have experienced isolated, 
policy-defined expansions in schooling achievement. Such expansions allow for us 
to causally identify the effect of education on maternal mortality if we believe 
that we can identify similar subgroups of individuals who are differentially 
affected by these isolated shocks to education. In these country case studies, we 
construct comparable subgroups of women who entered school on either side of an 
important educational reform.  We exploit variation in the intensity of treatment 
between regions and cohorts of birth to estimate the effect of educational 
expansions on maternal mortality.

Prominent educational reforms discussed in the economics literature are listed 
below in table \ref{MMRtab:EducExp}.  Of the reforms listed here, we identify 
three which are suitable to use as natural experiments to identify the effect of 
education on maternal mortality.  These are Nigeria, Zimbabwe, and Kenya. Of the 
other three cases listed, they were either not examined as they occurred too 
recently to observe the outcome of interest (maternal mortality) or because 
microdata for maternal mortality outcomes was not available for the country in 
question. For each of the three natural experiments examined, we briefly describe 
the nature of the reform, and the identification strategy used in estimation.

\subsubsection{Nigeria 1976}
\label{ssscn:empiricsNigeria}
The Universal Primary Education (UPE) program was initiated in Nigeria in 
September 1976 as a national program directed at primary school enrolment. This 
program involved the provision of free primary school education, along with 
significant classroom construction \citep{OsiliLong2008}. The gross primary 
enrolment rate doubled between 1974 and 1981 for male students, and nearly 
tripled for females.  \citet{OsiliLong2008} suggest using a double-differences 
identification strategy in which women from cohorts born between 1970 and 1975 in 
high-intensity states\footnote{Prior to the UPE program the non-Western states of 
Nigeria had low primary enrolment rates and low levels of investment per capita.  
With the introduction of the UPE, these states experienced a considerable 
expansion in educational investments \citep{OsiliLong2008}, and so are defined as 
`high-intensity' states.} act as the treatment group. As per 
\citeauthor{OsiliLong2008}, rather than opt for a control group immediately older 
than the treatment group, we examine women born between 1956-1961 in order for our 
analysis to not be confounded by over- and under-age enrolments in primary school.  
We also examine the effect on cohorts born between 1965 and 1970, which may be 
partially affected by the reform given over-age enrolment in primary school.

Two measures of treatment intensity are defined: a dummy for those living in 
high-intensity states, and a measure of federal capital funds dispersed per capita 
in each state in 1976 (the year of the reform)\footnote{Two additional treatment 
measures are examined by interacting funds per capita with treatment state, and 
funds per capita with number of years affected by the treatment. Further details 
are available as notes to Table \ref{MMRtab:Nigeria}.}.  The effect of UPE on 
schooling and maternal mortality is then estimated using a difference-in-difference 
framework:
\begin{equation}
 \label{eqn:Nigeria}
  y_{ijk}=\alpha + \beta \text{ UPE Cohort}_{jk}+\gamma \text{UPE Input}_k+
   \delta(\text{UPE Input}_k\times\text{UPE Cohort}_{jk})+
   \textbf{X}^\prime_{ijk}\theta+\varepsilon_{ijk}.
\end{equation}
The schooling and maternal mortality outcomes ($y$) for individual $i$ in cohort 
$j$ and state $k$ are regressed on controls for year of birth, religion, 
ethnicity, and additional controls for groups differentially affected by the 
1967-`70 civil war (see \citet{Akreshetal2012} for further discussion.)  The UPE 
Cohort dummy captures whether an individual was of primary school age at the time 
of the reform (year of birth between 1970 and 1975 inclusive), and UPE Input is a 
dummy for whether an invididual resides in a high-intensity treatment state, or 
the investment per capita of a given individual's state as discussed above.  For 
educational outcomes we expect that $\delta$---the reduced form estimate of the 
effect of UPE---should be positive, and, if education reduces maternal mortality, 
that $\delta<0$ for maternal mortality outcomes.  Further details and summary 
statistics for outcome and treatment variables are provided in section 
\ref{scn:data}.

\subsubsection{Zimbabwe 1980}
\label{ssscn:empiricsZimbabwe}
\citet{AgueroBharawadj2011} use extensions of schooling availability to black 
citizens in 1980 after independence in Zimbabwe to isolate the effect of 
education on health investments. This extension in years of education was 
observed in high-school age students, with the authors demonstrating a 
discontinuity between the ages of 14 and 15.  The reform in question occurred in 
April 1980, and has been used in the literature in earlier papers (see for 
example \citet{Edwards1995}).

In estimating the effect of the reform we follow \citet{AgueroBharawadj2011} in 
estimating around the discontinuity in educational attainment between the cohorts 
aged 14 and 15 in 1980: 
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Zimbabwe}
    y_{ij}=\beta_1\text{DumAge}_{ij}+
    \beta_2\text{DumAge}_{ij}\times(\text{Age}80_{ij}-14)+
    \beta_3(1-\text{DumAge}_{ij})\times(\text{Age}80_{ij}-14)+ 
    \textbf{X}^\prime_{ij}\theta+\varepsilon_{ij}.
\end{equation}
Here $DumAge$ takes the value of 1 for those aged 14 or less in 1980, and 0 for 
all women aged over 14 in 1980, and linear trends are fitted on each side of this 
cutoff.\footnote{This is in line with that suggested by 
\citet{AgueroBharawadj2011}.  We also present results estimated with a quadratic 
and cubic trend.} The $\textbf{X}_{ij}$ vector includes controls for age at 1980, 
survey fixed-effects, region fixed effects, and a rural dummy variable.  In this 
context $\beta_1$ is the reduced-form estimate of the effect of the expansion on 
education and maternal mortality outcome variables.

\subsubsection{Kenya 1985}
\label{ssscn:empiricsKenya}
A primary school reform in Kenya in 1985 resulted in a change in the structure of 
education from a ``7-4-2-3'' system (7 years primary education, 4 years of lower 
secondary, 2 years of upper secondary, and 3 years of tertiary) to an ``8-4-4'' 
system. Significantly, this means an increase by one year in required primary 
schooling to receive the Kenyan Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE). This 
reform was sharp, taking place nationally in January of 1985 by allowing no 
students to progress from primary to secondary education in this school 
year. \citet{Chicoine2011} shows that this has a significant impact on years of 
completed schooling, both for those women who complete only primary school, as for 
those women who progress to secondary education. \citet{Chicoine2011} demonstrates 
that for those individuals born prior to or in 1963, there is null (or very low)
probability that they will be treated by the 1985 reform in Kenya. For those born 
between 1963 and 1972, the probability of treatment is an increasing function of 
birth year, and for those born post-1972 they are treated with a probability of 1 
(where `treatment' implies matriculating to secondary school after 1985, and hence 
completing an additional year of primary schooling).

A treatment variable is then defined in line with the probability that an 
individual in each cohort is affected by the reform.  This variable is 
approximately identical to that defined by \citet{Chicoine2011}.  We use this 
treatment in a reduced form equation of the following form:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Kenya}
     y_{ijq}=\alpha+\beta\text{Treat}_{jk}+\textbf{age}_{ijq}^\prime\gamma+
     \textbf{qob trend}_{jq}^\prime \delta +\textbf{X}^\prime_{ijq}\theta+
     \varepsilon_{ijq},
\end{equation}
where as in the prior subsections we estimate the effect of the plausibly 
exogenous treatment on individual $i$, from cohort $j$, and, in this case, as per 
\citet{Chicoine2011}, control for quarter of birth $q$.  The vectors \textbf{age} 
(in years) and \textbf{quarter of birth trend} include cubic and quadratic terms 
respectively, while $\mathbf{X}_{ijq}$ includes a quarter of birth fixed effects, 
ethnicity, and rural/urban controls.

%DATA
%================================================================================
\section{Data}
\label{scn:data}
\subsection{Cross-Country Regressions}
\label{sscn:datacross}

Measures of educational attainment come from the cross--country dataset compiled 
by \citet{BarroLee2013, BarroLee2010} which provides data on total years of 
schooling, years of schooling by education level (primary, secondary and 
tertiary), plus a measure of the proportion of the population with each level of 
education (primary, secondary and tertiary) or with no formal education.  The 
Barro-Lee data allows us to observe the evolution of national attainment figures 
over time in five-year age groups, both for the entire population, and for the 
subgroup of females. The age-specific nature of this dataset allows for us to 
limit our analysis to individuals of fertile age, which for simplicity we define 
as between the ages of 15 and 39.\footnote{Similar estimates are run for the age 
group 15-49. The qualitative implications of the estimates do not change.} We 
also construct educational measures based upon individual data collected in the 
Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS).  This data allows for us to observe the 
education outcomes reported by a representative sample of individuals in a 
subsample of countries, and allow us to test the robustness of the results using 
the Barro-Lee data. The DHS education data can be constructed at the regional 
(sub-country) level and we take advantage of this for our country-specific 
estimates, as well as for a robustness check in cross-country results.

The education data are merged by country and year with information on maternal 
mortality ratios (hereafter MMR) provided by the World Health Organization 
\citep{WHO2012}. The MMR indicator is calculated by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) using figures collected in household surveys and 
administrative records for maternal mortality and live births. Maternal 
deaths are classified (ICD 10) as those mothers who die from any cause ``related 
to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or 
incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of 
termination of pregnancy\ldots''.\footnote{A full description is provided by 
The World Health Organization at 
\url{http://apps.who.int/gho/indicatorregistry/App_Main/view_indicator.aspx?iid=26}} 
Given concerns of underreporting by member states and the difficulty in compiling 
accurate measures of maternal mortality, point estimates are reported along with 
confidence intervals in the MMR dataset used.

Merging Barro-Lee and MMR data results in a panel of 146 countries with 
observations over a period of 20 years (1990-2010). Both sets of data provide 
observations on a 5-yearly cycle; 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010. To this main 
dataset we add measures for the log of GDP per capita, immunization rates---which 
we consider an imperfect proxy for national health expenditures---and fertility 
which are accessed from The World Bank Data Bank. We construct two further 
variables for the analysis by combining results from household surveys with 
available, but sporadic, cross-country measures. In order to control for births
attended by skilled health staff and for the adolescent fertility rate, we use 
household data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for that subset of 
countries and time periods for which a DHS survey is available. Where DHS data is 
not available, we access more complete cross-country data provided by 
\citet{WorldBank2012} Data Bank. A precise description of what these variables 
represent and how they are constructed is provided in appendix 
\ref{scn:dataappendix}.  The full merged dataset is available for download from 
the authors' webpage.

The estimation sample with non-missing data for all relevant variables contains 
108 countries observed quinquennially through 1990-2010. The panel is unbalanced 
containing gaps in years in which attended births or adolescent fertility 
observations are not available. A full list of countries and years of 
availability is presented in table \ref{MMRtab:survey} in appendix 
\ref{scn:appTables}, and summary statistics are presented in table 
\ref{MMRtab:sumstats} below.

Trends in maternal mortality and education in the cross-country sample are 
displayed in figures \ref{fig:EducRegion}-\ref{fig:MMRRegion}. There is 
considerable variation both across time and continents, but overall a 
consistently positive trend in years of schooling, and a negative trend in 
regional maternal mortality figures. Exceptionally, in sub-Saharan Africa, 
maternal mortality stagnated between 1990-1995, beginning to fall in line with 
other regions during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Despite reductions in maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, this region still 
had overwhelmingly the highest rates of maternal death associated with childbirth 
in 2010 (Figure \ref{fig:MMRGlobal}). Whilst certain countries in South, Central 
and East Asia, along with Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America have 
achieved ratios of less than 100 deaths per 100,000 births, all but a small 
hand-full of sub-Saharan countries still have ratios which exceed 300 per 100,000 
births.


\subsection{Natural Experiments}
\label{sscn:dataexp}
In order to focus on country-specific case studies, we use micro-level survey 
data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). These surveys focus on 
maternal and child health, and have a module focusing on maternal mortality. This 
maternal mortality module of the DHS is based upon the sisterhood method, where 
surveyed women are asked about sisters who have died, and whether death was during 
or related to child-birth \citep{RutsteinRojas2006}. These surveys allow us to 
calculate cohort specific maternal mortality rates, which can be combined with 
similarly calculated cohort specific educational attainment figures. As 
we do not have educational data on women who have died during childbirth and are 
not available to be surveyed, we use the microdata from the DHS respondents 
themselves.  Effectively we work with two individual-level databases: a maternal 
mortality database of all sisters of respondents and their survival status, and 
an education database with years of completed education of all survey respondents.

Given that we observe data on each respondent's sisters and their survival 
status, our maternal mortality measure in this case is at the level of the woman, 
\emph{not} at the level of the birth.  While in the cross-country specification 
(\ref{eqn:panel}) we examine deaths per 100,000 births, in each country case we 
examine deaths per woman (or the probability that a woman dies in child birth) 
over her fertile life. This latter measure is referred to as maternal mortality 
rate, and reflects both the risk of maternal death per birth and the frequency of 
births in a population.  The maternal mortality rate and the maternal mortality 
ratio are not directly comparable without some measure of the fertility in a given 
country. In the results section of this paper we use fertilty data described in 
section \ref{sscn:datacross} to provide a rough comparison of the results from 
cross-country and country-specific estimates.

The DHS interviews women aged 15-49 at the time of the survey. To correct 
for the fact that many women are interviewed before they have completed their 
fertility (younger cohorts in the sample), as a robustness check we use the 
correction method discussed by \citet{RutsteinRojas2006} and 
\citet{Stantonetal1997}. This involves weighting each age cohort by an adjustment 
factor, which is calculated based upon its exposure to maternal mortality.%
\footnote{These adjustment factors have been calculated as 0.107, 0.206, 0.343, 
0.503, 0.664, 0.882, and 0.900 for five age groups from 15-19 to 45-49 
(respectively).}  We note however that in the empirical strategies outlined in 
section \ref{scn:empiricalexperiment}, all identification is either based upon a 
double-difference estimator, or includes appropriate cohort-specific trends, so 
we expect that variation in exposure to maternal mortality should be accounted for 
even in the absence of this correction.

Table \ref{MMRtab:sumstatsexperiment} presents summary statistics from the DHS 
data for each of these country-specific experiments.  In each case we present 
descriptive statistics for years of education, maternal mortality rate, and 
treatment intensity, along with the time period examined in the natural 
experiment of interest.  In Zimbabwe and Kenya, the two countries in which the 
natural experiments occurred at the secondary or upper-primary level, average 
educational attainment is approximately 7-8 years for all women in the sample, 
while in Nigeria, where the natural experiment of interest involves primary school 
construction, average education in the cohorts of interest is approximately 5 
years.  In each case, over the entire range of cohorts examined, betwee 1 and 2 
in every 100 women dies during child birth.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Global}
\subsubsection{The Sensitivity of Maternal Mortality to Education (and Health 
Interventions)}
Table \ref{MMRtab:MMRpercent} provides results for our principal cross-country 
specification (\ref{eqn:panel}), estimated on cross-country panel data for 108 
developing countries observed at five yearly intervals in 1990-2010, and using 
the percentage 
of people in a country and year who have attained specified levels of education. 
We present similar results disaggregated by country income group and regional 
classifications as tables \ref{MMRtab:MMRregion} and \ref{MMRtab:MMRincome} 
respectively. In order to test the robustness of our results to alternative 
specifications of measures of education, we run regressions using years of 
education and years of education squared, and these results are included as 
appendix tables \ref{MMRtab:MMRyrs} and \ref{MMRtab:MMRyrssq}. We start with a 
simple panel data specification in which the identifying variation is within 
countries over time, with country fixed effects absorbing all country-specific 
time-invariant components of, for instance, political institutions, climate, 
culture and deep-set attitudes towards women that may produce a correlation 
between education and maternal mortality. We then add flexible controls for 
aggregate trended unobservables and for country and time-varying variables that 
we expect are correlated with education and maternal mortality.

The pooled within-country correlation of maternal mortality rates with women's 
education is significantly negative for the percent of the population attaining 
each education level. The estimates suggest that the MMR-returns to investment 
in women's education are positive and weakly diminishing in level of education
(this is confirmed by fitting a quadratic in total years of education:\ the 
quadratic term is positive and significant but the turning point lies outside 
the sample range). The point estimates are consistently largest for primary 
education but they are not statistically significantly different from the 
estimates for higher levels of education.

The estimates are robust to the introduction of year dummies, and further 
time-varying controls which reflect changes in the health and development status 
of a country. When examining coefficients by region- and income-specific groups 
(tables \ref{MMRtab:MMRregion} and \ref{MMRtab:MMRincome}), we find that the 
relationship between educational improvements and MMR reduction is larger in lower 
income environments (consistent with their higher baseline rates of maternal 
mortality and their lower baseline levels of education).

Column (2) is the favoured specification. It shows that, conditional upon 
aggregate trends in maternal mortality, if an additional one percent of the 
population enrolled in primary education this would lower the number of maternal 
deaths by 10 per 100,000 live births (The omitted group is the percent of the
population with no formal education). This coefficient is estimated with 
precision (a p-value less than 0.01). It denotes a large impact, equivalent to 
0.04 of a standard deviation and 5\% of the mean maternal mortality rate in the 
sample. It is illustrative to consider the impact of moving the entire population 
of individuals with no education---on average 17.5\% of women---into enrolment in 
primary education. Our estimates suggest this would lower MMR by 175.5 per 100,000 
births, which is 0.58 of a s.d.\ of total MMR. The addition of controls in the 
remaining columns of the table lowers the coefficient on primary education but in 
no case is it significantly different from the coefficient in column 2. In the 
richest model, conditional upon controls for economic and health variables (column 
7), the point estimate on primary education is reduced to almost two thirds of its 
initial size (column 2). For policy purposes it can be useful to look at the 
estimates conditional and unconditional upon alternative sets of controls since 
cohort changes in primary education will sometimes evolve similarly to changes in 
the controls that we introduce. We examine this in the following section.

Conditional on the controls introduced, the coefficients on secondary and tertiary 
education also remain significant. An additional percent of the population moving 
into secondary education lowers maternal mortality by 10 in 100,000 births. The 
effect of moving the sample population of uneducated women of fertile age into 
secondary education is estimated to create a mean reduction in maternal mortality 
of 172 (0.77 s.d.) in addition to the reduction of 196 associated with their passage 
through primary education. So the total impact of moving all uneducated women into 
secondary education is a reduction in MMR of 368 deaths per 100,000 births.

In columns 3-7 we introduce a succession of controls for the state of the
economy, public health care, and fertility. We control for the logarithm of per 
capita GDP so as to assess whether education is simply proxying income. We find 
that it is not; the coefficients on education are unchanged and the coefficient 
on GDP is insignificantly different from zero (column 3). This is important, 
given that the most recent WHO factsheet on maternal mortality highlights 
differences in maternal mortality ratios by income and not education level
\citep{WHO2012}.

Another widely recognised stylized fact highlighted in the WHO factsheet is that 
maternal mortality is a function of health services. We investigate this, 
introducing into the equation, DPT immunization rates for children as an indicator 
of the quality of public health provision.\footnote{UNICEF for instance regards 
immunization rates as indicating the quality of overall public health provision 
in developing countries. Most immunization is directed at children under the age 
of 12 (and sometimes up to 24) months and our measure of immunization rates 
pertains to children but it includes tetanus and tetanus injections for pregnant 
mothers are part of routine prenatal care and in this way immunization rates may
also directly influence maternal mortality.} The coefficient on primary 
education falls by about 10\% but this drop is not statistically 
significant. Immunization has a direct impact on maternal mortality. A one 
standard deviation increase in immunization rates (which is 15.9\% points) lowers 
maternal mortality by 45 per 100,000 birth, which is 0.14 s.d.\ or 20\% of the 
mean (column 5).

We also include in the equation an index of health provision that is more 
directly related to maternal mortality. Skilled care before, during and after 
childbirth is recognised in the public health community to save the lives of both 
women and new-born babies. Maternal deaths tend to occur because of bleeding and
infection and timely management and treatment can make the difference between life 
and death \citep{WHO2012}. India and Nepal for instance have, in the last decade, 
introduced financial incentives to encourage women to give birth in facilities 
with birth attendants rather than at home \citep{Milleretal2012,
PowellJacksonHanson2012}. We find that the percentage of births attended by a 
skilled professional is associated with lower maternal mortality conditional upon 
immunization (column 8). A one s.d.\ increase in the percentage of births attended 
(which is 27.6\% points) results in a drop in MMR of 35 which is 0.11 s.d.\ or 16\% 
of the mean. Conditioning upon birth attendance does not alter the immunization 
coefficient.

The measure of maternal mortality that we use here is per live birth and so it is 
mechanically a function of the number of live births in the country and, plausibly, 
a function of fertility (the number of births per woman). Women in developing 
countries have on average many more pregnancies than women in developed countries, 
and their lifetime risk of death due to pregnancy is higher. A woman's lifetime 
risk of maternal death---the probability that a 15 year old woman will eventually 
die from a maternal cause---is 1 in 3,800 in developed countries, versus 1 in 150 
in developing countries. Introducing the fertility rate in column 7, we see that an 
additional birth per mother is associated with an 
increase in maternal mortality of 28 per 100,000 live births or that a one s.d.\ 
increase in fertility (which is 1.7 births) leads to 48 additional maternal deaths, 
which is 0.16 of a s.d.\ or 22\% of mean fertility. In the main specification 
however it should be noted that the effect of total fertility is weakly estimated, 
and not significant at typical levels of confidence.

Teenage fertility is highly prevalent in developing countries, and this is 
closely associated with women dropping out of school early. Adolescent women face 
relatively high risks of complications and death as a result of pregnancy than 
older women \citep{Condeetal2005, Pattonetal2009}.  Whether this is because such 
women are negatively selected or because they are biologically more at risk is 
unclear and we know of no causal evidence on this. Introducing into the model the 
percentage of women who give birth at age 15-19, we find a significantly positive 
association. A one s.d.\ increase in the percent of teen births (which is 46 
percentage points) results in 91 more maternal deaths per 100,000 births, which is 
0.31 s.d.\ and 42\% of the mean. Overall, in standardised terms, the association 
of maternal mortality with fertility and the prevalence of teen births is stronger 
than its association with either health interventions or education. It is well 
established that education tends to lower fertility and raise age at birth.  In 
standardized terms, the impacts of primary and secondary education, DPT 
immunization rates and attended delivery on the maternal mortality ratio are almost
identical, each conditional upon the others. To the extent that standardized 
estimates are useful, this suggests that the payoff to basic education in terms of 
a health sector outcome is equal to or larger than the payoff to a common index of 
provision in the health sector. This contributes to a literature documenting 
synergies between investments in education and health.  It is of particular import 
for policy given that WHO policy documents on maternal mortality have 
under-emphasised education.

\paragraph{Alternative specification of education}
The specification in appendix Table \ref{MMRtab:MMRyrs} (column 2) suggests that an 
additional year of education for all women lowers the number of maternal deaths 
by 54 per 100,000 live births. A one standard deviation increase in years of 
education, of 3.21 years, would lower MMR by 173 per 100,000 births, which is 0.58 
of a s.d.\ of MMR. The introduction of controls---particularly the addition of 
immunization---renders the linear years of education variable insignificant, 
although the coefficient is still negative. In appendix Table 
\ref{MMRtab:MMRyrssq} we show estimates using a quadratic in years of education,
the functional form suggested by a non-parametric plot of the relationship of 
interest (see Figure \ref{fig:educmmr}). The education coefficient is now robust 
to the introduction of immunization and other controls. With the exception of 
fertility which is now significant and of larger magnitude, other controls 
behave similarly in terms of their effects on MMR as the estimates in Table 
\ref{MMRtab:MMRpercent} discussed earlier. The linear and quadratic terms in education are 
significant and they indicate continuously positive but diminishing marginal 
returns (in terms of MMR reductions) to years of education. The estimates in 
column 2 show that moving from 0 to 1 year of education is associated with a 
reduction of 210 deaths per 100,000 live births, while moving from 5 to 6 years 
of education is associated with a smaller, but still very significant, reduction 
of 94 maternal deaths per 100,000 births. In the model with all controls (column 
8) these estimates are attenuated slightly but still suggest significant effects: 
reductions of 175 deaths and 65 deaths respectively when moving from 0 to 1 or 
from 5 to 6 years of education.

Finally, while we have only a limited number of observations for maternal
mortality and education for each country in our cross-country data, in figure
\ref{fig:arrows} we examine correlations between maternal mortality and 
education both across and within countries.  The clear negative relationship
is once again seen when plotting country averages of log MMR against years of
schooling (the solid points in figure \ref{fig:arrows}).  However, regression
results are not only driven by this across-country result.  Intra-country
correlations appear to also be negative in the large majority of cases. Arrows
overlayed on top of country averages show that, in a given country, increases
in education are associated with reductions in log MMR in 116 of 146 cases,
and is unrelated or positively related in only 30 cases.

\subsubsection{Education, Female Education, or Male Education?}
\label{ssscn:gender}
Thus far, all regression results present the conditional effect of female 
education on maternal mortality.  However, fundamentally, we have \emph{not} 
controlled for the educational attainment of other members of the population, 
precluding us from being able to conclude that these effects are only due to 
\emph{women's} education.  The inclusion of women's education in a regression 
without controlling for male education may be problematic, especially when 
considering that levels of female and male education in a country, on average, 
are highly correlated.\footnote{For example, in the Barro-Lee sample used in this 
paper the $R^2$ of a regression of female to male education and an intercept is 
0.918, while the coefficient on male education is 1.190.}

In this section we turn to results which allow us to test whether increases 
in male or in female education drive reductions in maternal mortality.  We
run a series of regressions as per (\ref{eqn:panel}), where now the vector
of educational variables $\mathbf{educ}_{it}$ contains measures of both male
and female education in the population.  We can thus test whether 
\emph{conditional} on male education, increases in female education cause
reductions in rates of maternal mortality.  And vice versa, conditioning on
female education, we can test whether higher levels of male education reduce
rates of maternal mortality.

In table \ref{MMRtab:MMRgender} we present results where education for each 
group of the population is measured by the percent with each level of 
education (primary, secondary or tertiary).  This is the analogue of table
\ref{MMRtab:MMRpercent}, however now for both genders.  Overwhelmingly, it is
apparent that the results we have discussed in the previous section are driven
\emph{only} by increases in education of the cohort of fertile women.  When
controlling for female education, the effect of the level of men's education in
the population of interest is never significantly different from zero.

Column 2 of table \ref{MMRtab:MMRgender} suggests that a 1\% increase in the
rate of completion of primary education among women is (unconditionally) 
associated with a reduction in the rate of maternal mortality of 11.33 per 
100,000 live births.  Similarly higher rates of secondary and tertiary 
completion among women reduce maternal mortality.  However, when turning to 
rates of male education, no effect is seen (with t-statistics nearly always
well below 1).  This result remains even when conditioning on our full set
of controls.  Column 7 shows that a 1\% increase in female rates of primary
education reduces MMR by 8.9 in 100,000 births, while a 1\% increase in male
primary education has a small positive (insignificant) relationship.

These results are stable regardless of the set of controls used, and also the
way in which education is mesured.  Appendix table \ref{MMRtab:MMRgenderSq} 
presents the same set of regressions with education measured as a quadratic
in years for males and females.  While the effect of female education on 
MMR---after controlling for male education---is a significant negative linear 
and positive quadratic effect (suggesting that education reduces maternal 
mortality, and that returns to education are diminishing)\footnote{Quadratic 
figures have a turning point from a negative to a positive effect on MMR at 
between 15.5 to 18.5 years of education (depending upon the set of controls 
included).  These values of considerably higher than the maximum sample value 
displayed in table \ref{MMRtab:sumstats}.}, the conditional effect of male 
education on maternal mortality rates is once again insignificant at all
levels in the sample range.  Similar effects are seen when education is
measured simply as years of schooling, providing considerable evidence that
it is actually the level of education of the women in the cohort that is 
important, not total educational attainment, or the attainment of men in the 
same cohort.


\subsubsection{Potential Pathways and Correlated Effects}
\label{ssscn:effects}
The discussion in the preceding sections establishes that declines in maternal 
mortality in developing countries have been associated with gains in education, 
improvements in public health services and declines in fertility. Since our 
primary interest in this paper is in the benefits flowing from education, in this 
section we consider the extent to which improvements in public health services and 
declines in fertility are themselves driven by improvements in education. We take 
each of the controls that were used in Table \ref{MMRtab:MMRpercent} (including 
GDP which had no significant impact on maternal mortality) and regress them on 
education conditional upon country fixed effects (Table \ref{MMRtab:Zscore}):
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Zscore}
  fert_{it}=\alpha + \mathbf{educ}^\prime_{it}\beta + \mathbf{W}^\prime_i\gamma 
  + u_{it}.
\end{equation}

We see that increases in education are significant predictors of within-country 
variation in fertility, immunization, the percentage of attended births and log 
per capita GDP. The dependent variables in Table \ref{MMRtab:Zscore} have been 
cast as z-scores (see notes to Table \ref{MMRtab:Zscore}) so the coefficients on 
the education variables indicate the standard deviation change in the outcome 
flowing from a one year increase in education at the specified level. For 
example, moving an additional percent of non-school attendees into primary 
education results in a 0.018 s.d.\ decline in fertility; an increase of 
approximately 0.014 s.d.\ in both immunization rates and attended births; and a 
0.008 s.d.\ increase in log GDP p.c.\ So education not only directly influences 
maternal mortality, it also is strongly correlated with other determinants of 
maternal mortality.

We can plug the relationships estimated in Table \ref{MMRtab:Zscore} into the 
specifications in Table \ref{MMRtab:MMRpercent}. For instance, using column 7 
in Table \ref{MMRtab:MMRpercent}, we found that a one s.d.\ reduction in 
fertility led to a 0.21 s.d.\ decline in MMR. Since Table \ref{MMRtab:Zscore} 
column 1 tells us that a single percentage increase in primary education years 
leads to a 0.0177 s.d.\ decline in fertility, it follows that there is a 
fertility-mediated impact of primary education on MMR of $0.0177\times 0.21$ or 
0.004 s.d. This is in addition to the direct impact of a year of primary 
education on MMR in column 7, which is 0.025 s.d. When considering that the total 
percent of women without formal education is much larger than the one percent 
which the preceding calculations assume, these effects can become quite large. 
Similar calculations can be made for education-led impacts of immunization and 
attended delivery on maternal mortality, and we present these calculations in the 
final row of table \ref{MMRtab:MMRpercent}. Rather than present these 
calculations as the impact of moving 1\% of women into primary education, we 
present the impact of moving all uneducated women into schooling. We consider 
this to be a more relevant indicator for policy. Overall, these results show that 
education is strongly positively correlated with health service provision 
conditional upon country fixed effects and aggregate trends. While this 
association may not be entirely causal, causal components such as that educated 
people demand public health services merit testing.

\subsection{Country-Specific Results}
We take advantage of the reforms described in sections 
\ref{ssscn:empiricsNigeria}-\ref{ssscn:empiricsKenya} to estimate the effect that 
plausibly exogenous within-country variation in education expansion has on 
maternal mortality rates. Regression results from these country-specific 
expansions in schooling are presented below in Tables \ref{MMRtab:Nigeria}-%
\ref{MMRtab:Kenya}. Each table displays reduced form results for the effect of 
the reform on educational attainment and on maternal mortality. For each case we 
also present a descriptive (graphical) summary of the evolution of education, 
maternal mortality, and the date of the educational reform (Figures 
\ref{fig:Nigeriaeduc}-\ref{fig:Zimbabwemmr}). In those graphs where two vertical 
cut-off points are plotted, the first signifies the tail end of the ``treatment'' 
group, while the second represents the beginning of the ``control'' group (with 
intermediate cohorts considered as transitionary, or partially affected). Whilst 
these figures are each plotted from data at the national level, the regression 
analysis presented in Tables \ref{MMRtab:Nigeria}-\ref{MMRtab:Kenya}, relies on 
sub-national variation resulting from variation in reform intensity by region. 

In each case as a robustness check we also examine the effect of some placebo 
reform. This placebo reform is defined by comparing birth cohorts who had 
completely finished the relevant level of school at the time of the reform, and 
hence who were both unaffected by the expansion in education.  We expect in this 
case that the effect of the false reform---on both education and maternal 
mortality---should not be significantly different to zero, while we expect that 
the true reform should increase educational attainment and reduce maternal 
mortality.  These placebo results are presented in appendix tables 
\ref{MMRtab:NigeriaPlacebo}-\ref{MMRtab:KenyaPlacebo}

With the exception of one of twenty different outcome treatment-outcome pairs, as 
expected we see that the placebo reform has no significant effect on either 
schooling or on maternal mortality.  This provides some evidence in favour of the 
functional form of equations (\ref{eqn:Nigeria}), (\ref{eqn:Zimbabwe}) and 
(\ref{eqn:Kenya}). Turning to the true reforms, we find that in all cases these 
significantly increased educational attainment. In Nigeria the effect of residing 
in a high-intensity state (column 2 of Table \ref{MMRtab:Nigeria}) is approximately 
2.1 additional years of education.  The effect of extensions in schooling 
availability due to independence in Zimbabwe is approximately 1.2 additional 
years,\footnote{This is very similar (and not significantly different) to the 
1.252 years estimated by \citet{AgueroBharawadj2011} using only two waves of the 
Zimbabwean DHS.} and the effect of the changes in the structure of the KCPE was an 
additional 0.95 years of education on average for female students.

Turning to the reduced form effect of these reforms on maternal mortality, we see 
that in two of the three cases: Nigeria and Zimbabwe, the reforms significantly 
reduce maternal mortality in the treated cohorts. The exception here is Kenya,
where we find a weakly positive (but not significantly different from zero) effect.  
The lack of a result in this country is perhaps unsurprising for two reasons.  
Firstly the educational expansion occurred at a relatively high level (between 
seven and eight years), while our earlier results suggest that the effect of 
education on maternal mortality is greatest when the educational expansion occurs 
at low levels.  Secondly, the DHS data on maternal mortality from Kenya is by far 
the noisiest, with large fluctuations by birth cohort over the range of the 
treatment period.

In the case of Nigeria we find statistically and economically significant 
reductions in maternal mortality by the age of 25 in response to the reform.  
Depending on the treatment examined, the effect is between a 1 and 2\% reduction 
in total mortality (or between 1 and 2 less women in 100 dying in child birth).  
In the case of Zimbabwe we find a slightly smaller effect of a 0.4\% reduction in 
total mortality.  Once again, it is perhaps not surprising that the effect of the 
Zimbabwe reform is smaller than the effect of the Nigeria reform, given that the 
Nigeria reform occured at the primary level, while the Zimbabwe reform largely 
increased educational attainment at the high school level.  We can calculate the 
approximate effect of an additional year of education by dividing the 
``second stage'' effect of the reform on maternal mortality by the ``first stage'' 
effect of the reform on education in years.  Using the preferred estimates from 
Tables \ref{MMRtab:Nigeria} and \ref{MMRtab:Zimbabwe}, this gives an estimate of 
$-0.0192/2.147=-0.0089$ and $-0.00413/1.148=-0.0033$ respectively.

How do these estimates compare with the cross-country estimates reported earlier? 
It turns out that they match up rather unexpectedly well with cross-country 
estimates for the effect of additional years of education. Recall that the 
cross-country estimates use WHO maternal mortality ratios which are maternal 
deaths per live birth while the country specific estimates use DHS maternal 
mortality rates which are maternal deaths per woman.  In order to provide a rough 
comparison, we use recent data \citep{CIA2012} on fertility per woman for Zimbabwe 
and Nigeria to convert the maternal deaths per woman estimates calculated in the 
paragraph above, to deaths per birth.  These figures of 3.61 and 5.38 births per 
woman (respectively), result in per-birth estimates of $0.0088/5.38=0.00166$, and 
$0.0036/3.61=0.00091$.  These correspond to an effect of 166 deaths per 100,000 
live births (for an expansion at the lower primary level), and 9.1 deaths per 
100,000 live births for an expansion in high school. When we use the years of 
schooling results from table \ref{MMRtab:MMRyrssq} (column 8), we find that an 
expansion in schooling from 1 to 2 years results in a reduction in MMR of 153.0 
deaths per 100,000 births, and an expansion from 7 to 8 years results in a 
reduction of 21.5 deaths per 100,000 births: quite close to the country-specific 
results from Nigeria and Zimbabwe.

%CONCLUSION
%===============================================================================
\section{Conclusion}
In the last two decades, maternal mortality has declined sharply (by 50\%) and 
education has risen sharply. The analysis in this paper suggests that some part 
of the decline in maternal mortality may be attributed to the rise in education. 
Using the cross-country data sample, we use the changes in maternal mortality, 
education and the control variables in the analysis between 1990 and 2010 to 
crudely simulate the contribution of education. In this twenty year period, the 
average percent of women with no formal education has fallen from 22 to 13\%. 
Applying this reduction of 9\% to the estimates in Table \ref{MMRtab:MMRpercent} 
suggests that education will have led to a decline in the maternal mortality 
ratio of 105 deaths per 100,000 births (unconditional) or about 71 (conditional 
upon health services and fertility which, we noted, are correlated with 
education). The actual decline in the maternal mortality ratio in the same twenty 
year period in our sample is 119. This suggests that education gains in this 
period can explain roughly half or possibly more of the observed decline in 
maternal mortality. Compare this with the role of attended births. The percentage 
of attended births has risen from 72\% to 82\%. Our estimates suggest that this 
will have led to a decline in MMR of 15 per 100,000 births. These simulations are 
only suggestive but the evidence overall does suggest that the rapid growth in 
education in developing countries may have made a substantial and largely 
unrecognised contribution to the dramatic declines in maternal mortality witnessed 
in recent years.

\section{Data Appendix}
\label{scn:dataappendix}
\subsection{Data for Panel Analysis}
The variable `Percent Attended Births' represents the number of births attended 
by a skilled physician.  This variable has been constructed from World Bank data 
relating to births attended by skilled health staff 
(\url{http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.BRTC.ZS}) and DHS data 
constructed from the cross-country micro data. The DHS data comes from a 
question regarding place of birth, where those mothers who report births in a 
public or private facility are assumed to have been attended by a skilled health 
professional.  

Given the sporadic nature of the data produced, the following procedure was 
followed: `Percent Attended Births' was set equal to the DHS microdata average 
for each year/country group pair for which this observation was available.  In 
the case that DHS data was not available and World Bank data was, `Percent 
Attended Births' was set equal to the rate from the World Bank data.  Given that 
MMR and Education data is available in 5 year periods (1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 
2010), for each of these years where the fifth year was not available but there 
was data in the preceeding 5 year period, the average of the preceeding 5 year 
period was taken and used as the data point in the fifth year.

\subsection{Data for Quasi-Experiments}
Micro-level data for education and maternal mortality is used in each country.
Both come from DHS.  For each country we pool all available DHS waves in which
the maternal mortality module was collected.  These are, for Zimbabwe: 1994, 
1999, 2005 and 2010; for Kenya: 1998, 2003, and 2008; and for Nigeria: 1999 and
2008.

From each respondent in the DHS Individual Recode file (ie all index women), we
use their education, along with their region of birth and residence, data of 
birth, and various characteristics such as ethnicity and religion.  To create a
maternal mortality database, we take information on all of the sisters of each
woman in the DHS data.  For these sisters, the index woman reports if they are
alive, their data of birth, if they died during child birth, and if so, in what 
the maternal death occurred.  From this, we generate a sisters file recording 
maternal mortality rates for each woman, (and hence birth cohorts). Full details
regarding all data, and data itself is available on the web

\section{Maternal Mortality in the Medical Literature}
\label{scn:medliterature}
The medical literature suggests that maternal mortality is principally 
associated with labour, delivery and the early postpartum period; largely 
occuring between the third trimester of pregnancy and the first post-partum 
week. The principal medical cause of these deaths is obstetric haemorrhage, a 
largely preventable cause provided ``access to timely and competent obstetric 
care'' is available \citep{RonsmansGraham2006}.  Along with haemorrhage, a number 
of other causes are reported, including sepsis, abortion, hypertensive disorders, 
obstructed labour, embolism and ectopic pregnancy\footnote{Highly cited figures 
\citep{WHOetal1991} suggest figures of 25\% due to haemorrhage, 20\% due to 
indirect causes, 15\% due to infection, 13\% due to abortions, 12\% due to 
eclampsia, 8\% to obstructed labour and 8\% to other direct causes. 
\citet{Khanetal2006} provide evidence broadly in agreement with these values 
however note that these estimates suffer from large confidence intervals.}.  
Despite the fact that these complications account for the majority of deaths 
during labour, birth and the post-partum period, the prevalence of each varies 
by region \citep{Khanetal2006}.  Whilst haemorrhage is the principal cause in 
developing regions, complications from caesarian sections and anaesthesia are more 
common in developed countries, and other region-specific disease burdens are noted 
(abortion in Latin America and the Caribbean, sepsis and HIV in Africa and anaemia 
in Asia).

Much focus in the existing literature is on the difficulty of obtaining accurate 
statistics of maternal mortality, particularly in those areas where maternal 
mortality is highest\citep{RonsmansGraham2006, MccarthyMaine1992, 
McAlisterBaskett2006}.  The ability to compile credible data is confounded by the 
lack of consistent classification prior to the introduction of ICD-9 coding, the 
need to collect data from an array of data sources, misclassification of maternal 
death, significant under-reporting of maternal mortality, and missing and 
incomplete data\citep{Yazbeck2007, Hoganetal2010}.

Early work\footnote{The Safe Motherhood Initiative of 1987 was put in place in 
response to the increasing recognition of this topic in developing countries.} 
in the medical literature highlighted the importance of addressing the `proximal 
causes' or inputs of maternal mortality; namely the likelihood that a women 
becomes pregnant, or the likelihood of complications (and the treatment of these 
complications) conditional upon her becoming pregnant \citep{MccarthyMaine1992, 
GoodburnCampbell2001, TrusselPebley1984}.  Along with attendence and medical 
care for mothers during pregnancy and child birth, these studies suggest that 
altering maternal age, quantity of births, and spacing of births could have a 
considerable effect on rates of maternal mortality.  

More recent medical studies also suggest that socioeconomic factors are 
fundamental in the reduction of maternal mortality.  \citet{Costelloetal2004}, 
for example, argue that the focus on primary care and skilled attendance is 
not a sufficient strategy, citing considerable reductions in maternal mortality 
following community-based interventions\footnote{Also see 
\citet{Manandharetal2004} for the results of a randomized trial of 
community-based meetings.}.  \citet{McAlisterBaskett2006} suggest that 
social---and specifically gender-specific factors such as female 
education---should predict maternal mortality, demonstrating cross-country 
correlation between these variables. Recent work from \citet{Ahmedetal2012} 
suggests that family planning inputs would allow for considerable reductions in 
maternal deaths world-wide, with the authors estimating that the equivalent of 
44\% of maternal deaths in 2008 were averted due to contraceptive use, and that 
meeting unmet demand for family planning could prevent a further 29\%. Finally, 
the importance of socio-economic factors is also highlighted by 
\citet{Ahmedetal2010} (and earlier by \citet{ShenWilliamson1999}) who suggest 
that more educated and empowered women are more likely to utilise health 
services related to maternal mortality such as antenatal care, and skilled 
birth attendants, and by \citet{BhuttaBlack2013} who higlight the social 
determinants of maternal health, and the link of poor health to poorly served 
urban slum environments where social and educational support networks are weak.
