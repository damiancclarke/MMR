  \floatfoot{\textsc{Notes to figure \ref{MMRWomparl}}: Each point
    represents the country average of $\Delta$ MMR and $\Delta$ educational indicator.
    $\Delta$ is the first difference, and is a country average over the period 1990-2010
    (the full MMR sample).  The inverse of Proportion out of School is used, so $\Delta$
    is interpreted as a \emph{reduction} in the proportion of women out of school.  Similar
    results are found when conditioning on changes in GDP per capita (see online appendix 
    figure A1).}

\floatfoot{\textsc{Notes to figure \ref{fig:EducAge}}: Each point and confidence interval
  represent the results from a regression of country MMR on the Proportion of Women of that
  age with completed primary education (as per specification \ref{eqn:panel}).  The regression
  includes variables for each level of education, and the controls and country and year fixed
  effects are included as per table \ref{MMRtab:MMRpercent}.  Standard errors are clustered
  by countr. Each regression consists of the estimation sample of 108 countries and 428 year
  by country observations from table \ref{MMRtab:MMRpercent}.}
